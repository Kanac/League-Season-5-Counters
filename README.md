# League Season 5 Counters

Completely revitalized version of the app from last year, implementing an Azure .Net backend for user submitted stats. Added every awesome feature that the Windows Phone API provides, ranging from background tasks implementing toast notifications, multi-threading with the UI thread and background tasks,  and organization of data with pivots. Also modelled my own implementations of the alphabetical jumplist and loading progress bars to simulate exactly how Microsoft does it with their in-house apps. Upvote/downvote feature is simulated from Reddit's style of voting and the comment feature is completely anonymous, requiring no constraints from the user. Aggregration of data is taken from multiple popular fan-websites utilising the HTML agility pack and JSON.Net to seamlessly implement my live stats feature.
